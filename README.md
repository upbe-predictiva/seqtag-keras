# This repo is a fork of https://github.com/Hironsan/anago

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/Hironsan/anago and is modified to suit my needs. The module's name is changed so that it doesn't conflict with the installation of the original repo and so that I can push my changes to PyPi.

The purpose of creating a fork (and a separate module) instead of using the excellent anago is as follows.

1. Anago's installation comes with ELMo, allennlp and some other stuff, which are not needed for the intended use cases of this repo (mainly DeepSegment). 
2. It's not easy to include a git repo link as a requirement in setup.py while publishing to PyPi. So, this module is renamed to seqtag-keras.

# Full credit and thanks for this repo goes to https://github.com/Hironsan/ and https://github.com/chakki-works/ .
